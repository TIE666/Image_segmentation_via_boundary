function J=regiongrowing(I,x,y,reg_maxdist)
% This function performs "region growing" in an image from a specified
% seedpoint (x,y)
%
% J = regiongrowing(I,x,y,t) 
% 
% I : input image 
% J : logical output image of region
% x,y : the position of the seedpoint (if not given uses function getpts)
% t : maximum intensity distance (defaults to 0.2)
%
% The region is iteratively grown by comparing all unallocated neighbouring pixels to the region. 
% The difference between a pixel's intensity value and the region's mean, 
% is used as a measure of similarity. The pixel with the smallest difference 
% measured this way is allocated to the respective region. 
% This process stops when the intensity difference between region mean and
% new pixel become larger than a certain treshold (t)
%
% Example:
%
% I = im2double(imread('medtest.png'));
% x=198; y=359;
% J = regiongrowing(I,x,y,0.2); 
% figure, imshow(I+J);
